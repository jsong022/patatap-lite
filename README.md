# Patatap-Lite

### Introduction
This is a simple clone of [Patatap](http://patatap.com/) which plays a sound with a simple animation when a key is pressed. The goal of this project is to further practicing JavaScript and using external libraries in my project.

It uses [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) for the animations and [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) for the sounds.
The sound files are from Patatap (found in its [github repo](https://github.com/jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony/tree/master/assets/A)) 

### To-Do
- [x] Make new circles appear when key is pressed
- [ ] Randomize new circles appearances (location & color)
- [ ] Animate the circles that appear
- [ ] Play a sound when a key is pressed
- [ ] \(Optional) Expand by experimenting with Paper.js and adding different animations
